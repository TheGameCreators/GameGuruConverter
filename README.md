GameGuru Classic Converter is a tool from the GameGuru Classic product, and is used to convert X files to DBO files. 

Steam Product: https://store.steampowered.com/app/266310/GameGuru/

This Guru-Converter.exe is to be placed in the GameGuru Classic root folder.

This source code requires Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition and is compiled as a 32-bit executable.

NOTE: If anyone would like to convert this project so it compiles and runs in 64-bit, that would be much appreciated. The DirectX code used to do the X file parsing is 32-bit only and there was no clear way of performing the same parse using a 64-bit executable. If this can be converted, the whole converter can be embedded into the now 64-bit version of GameGuru Classic.
